### **Step-by-Step Execution**

---

### **Step 1: Join Student and Enrollment tables**

Join `Student` table (stu) with `Enrollment` table (enr) on `StudentID`.

```sql
   SELECT stu.StudentID, stu.StudentName, stu.Age, stu.Department, enr.CourseID, enr.Semester, E.Grade
   FROM Student AS stu
   JOIN Enrollment AS enr ON stu.StudentID = enr.StudentID;
```

| StudentID | StudentName | Age | Department             | CourseID | Semester    | Grade |
| --------- | ----------- | --- | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1         | Alice       | 20  | Computer Science       | 101      | Fall 2023   | A     |
| 2         | Bob         | 22  | Information Technology | 102      | Spring 2024 | B     |
| 3         | Charlie     | 21  | Computer Science       | 101      | Fall 2023   | A-    |
| 4         | David       | 23  | Electrical Engineering | 103      | Spring 2024 | C     |

---

### **Step 2: Join the result with the Course table**

Now, join the intermediate result from Step 1 with the `Course` table (C) on `CourseID`.

| StudentID | StudentName | Age | Department             | CourseID | Semester    | Grade | Title                      | Credit |
| --------- | ----------- | --- | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 1         | Alice       | 20  | Computer Science       | 101      | Fall 2023   | A     | Database Management System | 3      |
| 2         | Bob         | 22  | Information Technology | 102      | Spring 2024 | B     | Operating Systems          | 4      |
| 3         | Charlie     | 21  | Computer Science       | 101      | Fall 2023   | A-    | Database Management System | 3      |
| 4         | David       | 23  | Electrical Engineering | 103      | Spring 2024 | C     | Electrical Circuits        | 3      |

---

### **Step 3: Apply the WHERE condition**

Filter the rows where the `Title` of the course is `'Database Management System'`.

| StudentID | StudentName | Age | Department       | CourseID | Semester  | Grade | Title                      | Credit |
| --------- | ----------- | --- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 1         | Alice       | 20  | Computer Science | 101      | Fall 2023 | A     | Database Management System | 3      |
| 3         | Charlie     | 21  | Computer Science | 101      | Fall 2023 | A-    | Database Management System | 3      |

---

### **Step 4: Select the final columns**

Finally, select the `StudentName` column from the filtered result.

StudentName

---

Alice

---

Charlie

---

---

### **Summary**

- The query joins three tables (`Student`, `Enrollment`, and `Course`) step by step.
- After joining, it filters the results to include only students enrolled in the "Database Management System" course.
- The final output shows the names of students who match the condition.

This process highlights how SQL performs joins and filtering across multiple tables.
