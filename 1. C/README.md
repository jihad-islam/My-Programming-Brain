# C Programming

This folder contains my learning journey in C programming. It includes examples and notes on:

- Basic syntax and structure.
- Control statements.
- Functions and recursion.
- Pointers and memory management.

## Example Code

- `example.c`: A simple "Hello, World!" program.
- `linked_list.c`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
